#ft_printf

This repository contains my implementation of the ft_printf function, which is a simplified version of the standard C library function printf. The ft_printf function can write formatted output to the standard output stream, using a format string and a variable number of arguments. The format string can contain conversion specifiers for different data types, such as integers, characters, strings, pointers, etc. The goal of this project is to practice variadic functions, memory management, and string manipulation in C.
